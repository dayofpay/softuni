            <h1>The power of music</h1>
            <p>We can all think of at least one song that, when we hear it, triggers an emotional response. It might be a song that accompanied the first dance at your wedding, for example, or a song that reminds you of a difficult break-up or the loss of a loved one.</p>

            <h1>An effective stress reliever</h1>
