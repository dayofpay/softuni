            The pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit.
            It is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.The 
            pineapple is indigenous to South America.
            Pineapples grow as a small shrub, the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant
             fuse to form a multiple fruit. The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced
              at the top of the fruit,or from a side shoot, and typically matures within a year.
